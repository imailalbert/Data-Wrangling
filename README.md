Springboard Data Wrangling exercises to deal with JSON files:

1. Find the 10 countries with most projects
2. Find the top 10 major project themes (using column 'mjtheme_namecode')
3. In 2. above you will notice that some entries have only the code and the name is missing. Create a dataframe with the missing names filled in.

One should note that to provide an accurate answer for exercise #2 one should complete exercise #3 to fill in the missing data. Otherwise, empty strings (missing data) will be included in the answer for exercise #2
